### Reflection

### Pitch

Reflection is a journalling app which allows a user to overlay their current emotional states upon their journal entries.

### Problem

Current approaches to mental health wellness include cultivating mindfullness towards one's inner emotional states.  This can be a surprisingly difficult task: an emotional response might be unwittingly supressed; a trigger for an emotional response might never be recognized; or the sheer power and duration of an emotion might leave someone wondering "why am I feeling this way?".  These disconnections between mind and feeling can compound on one another and lead to various forms of mental instability or pain.

### Solution

The Reflection app allows for a user to journal -- already a common perscribed treatment in many forms of therapy -- while also prompting exploration into current mood and emotional wellbeing with quantified queries about their emotions at a given time.  Reflection's dashboard returns the user's emotional data at a glance by combining their emotional responses with their journal entry titles, all plotted in a sequence over time.  The dashboard can therefore show patterns in emotions over time and content which may be helpful for someone in gaining insight into their own mental wellbeing.

### Target Audience

The target user is for anyone who wishes to learn more about themselves and the way they react and handle their life's circumstances and situations.  Those who are willing to ponder and reflect on themselves will see the most benefits.

### Integrations

The app will rely heavily on the Google Drive API both for OAuth, and importantly, for storing journal entries.  This will give the burden of privacy to Google Drive, while also providing for easy sharing functions (for when a user wishes to share a journal entry, or a dashboard snapshot).
